I am a **Software / Product Engineer** based in San Francisco who believes software should feel magic and run reliably.

My background is a deliberate hybrid of high-reliability data infrastructure at **Wells Fargo**, ensuring zero data loss at enterprise scale, and pushing the boundaries of **Apple Vision Pro** and **Gaussian Splatting** by building novel immersive products.

I am currently seeking a Founding Engineer or Product Engineer role at a high-growth startup where I can own the full stack, from the database architecture to the UI.

## Selected Work

I build engines and SDKs too, not just apps. Here is a breakdown of my recent engineering challenges:

### [SHARP Memories](/posts/sharp-memories)
**The "Nostalgia" Product.**
I built a cross-platform app that converts a single 2D photo into a 3D Gaussian Splat. It uses an event-driven serverless architecture (Supabase + Modal) to deliver AI-generated 3D assets to an iOS App Clip for sharing easily.

### [Immersive Watch Party SDK](/posts/immersive-watch-party)
**The "Experience" Engineering.**
VR is isolating, so I fixed it. I made an SDK that syncs `AVPlayer` instances across devices combined with Spatial Personas and packaged it into a drop-in binary framework. It's a feature that not even Apple has solved for the Vision Pro yet.

### [Vantage](/posts/vantage-vr-sports-platform)
**What I like.**
I'm a huge UFC fan. I made combat sports streaming app for spatial computing. Watching MMA on Vantage feels like you're sitting in the arena. Combined with the ImmersiveWatchPartySDK, it demonstrates a killer use case for the future of VR.

### [Wells Fargo Infrastructure](/posts/wells-fargo-data-engineering)
**The Foundation.**
My work migrating legacy ETL pipelines to modern tools in Google Cloud taught me the importance of observability, rigorous testing, and handling failure states gracefully.
