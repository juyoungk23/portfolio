Hello, I'm Juyoung Kim — a **Software Engineer** and **Product Builder** based in San Francisco.

I specialize in bridging the gap between complex backend systems and polished user experiences. Currently, I not only build and upgrade data infrastructure at **Wells Fargo**, but I also build immersive 3D/XR products that push the boundaries of the browser and mobile devices.

## What I do

- **Ship end-to-end products:** I take ideas from 0 to 1, handling everything from database architecture (Supabase/Postgres) to native UI (SwiftUI/React/NextJS).
- **Build immersive tech:** I make cutting-edge experiences happen through tech.
- **Design reliable systems:** I apply enterprise-grade rigor to data pipelines and APIs, ensuring applications are observable, scalable, and robust.

## Why I like this work

I love how tech enables such **creative prototyping** and **systems engineering**. I don't just want to make things work; I want to make them feel like magic. Whether it's on the web/iOS/visionOS, architecting a cloud sync engine, or equipping data infrastructure with modern tools, I love solving technical hurdles that directly unlock better user experiences.
