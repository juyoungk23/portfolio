Hello, I'm Juyoung Kim — a data engineer at Wells Fargo and a full-stack developer who loves creating immersive VR experiences. I enjoy solving tough technical problems with creative solutions across the stack.

## What I do

- Build data pipelines and tools that are reliable and observable.
- Ship full-stack features end to end, from APIs to polished UI.
- Prototype quickly and iterate on novel XR interactions.

## Why I like this work

I get energy from hard problems, especially when the solution combines systems thinking with thoughtful user experience. I'm comfortable moving between data engineering, backend, frontend, and XR — whatever the job calls for.
