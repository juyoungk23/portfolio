At Wells Fargo, I engineer the backend data infrastructure that powers internal reporting dashboards. My focus is on refactoring legacy technical debt into performant, cloud-native architectures.

## Core Engineering

- **System Migration:** Designed a high-throughput migration pipeline from MongoDB to SQL for legacy systems, achieving **zero data loss** and 100% data integrity validation.
- **Performance Optimization:** Refactored bottlenecked Python ETL scripts, reducing data processing latency by **60%** to enable faster internal reporting.
- **Release Management:** Led monthly production deployment cycles, orchestrating code integration across multiple distributed teams and enforcing strict SDLC standards.

## The "Product" Angle

While the stack is enterprise (Teradata, Informatica), the discipline is universal. I bring **reliability engineering** habits—defensive coding, rigorous data validation, and uptime focus—to product development.

## Tech Stack

Python, SQL, Shell Scripting, GCP, Postgres, MongoDB.
