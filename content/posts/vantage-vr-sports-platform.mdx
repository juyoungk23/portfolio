I'm a huge UFC fan and this is my passion project. 
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vantage-vr/id6698850979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vantage</a> is a cross-platform (visionOS, Meta Quest) immersive sports network built to solve the isolation problem in VR. It combines high-fidelity stereoscopic VR180 capture with a novel social layer that synchronizes playback across devices with minimal latency.

## Why I built Vantage

For me, the thought of sitting cage-side at a UFC event with my friends, reacting to every technique and knockout blow, is the reason that propelled me to build Vantage. With modern mixed-reality devices, it is now becoming possible to experience this virtually.

While the consumer VR market remains niche, Vantage serves as a production-grade proving ground for advanced spatial computing architectures, including **Shared Presence** experiences and custom RealityKit rendering pipelines.

## The "Fan" Experience

Building a Netflix-style VOD app is a solved problem. Building a **synchronous, spatially-aware social theater** on first-generation hardware (Apple Vision Pro) is not:

1.  **Stereoscopic 180° Video:** 8K 3D playback at 60fps.
2.  **Spatial Personas:** Rendering remote users in the local coordinate space with correct depth occlusion.
3.  **Frame-Perfect Sync:** Keeping 5+ clients perfectly aligned for "live" reactions.

## Core Engineering Features

### 1. The "Simulated Live" Premieres
Live events are much more exciting because we don't yet know the outcome. The story is unfolding in realtime. Although doing a true, fully live stereoscopic broadcast was not feasible, I figured I could get most of the way there and provide fans like me an awesome experience by "simulating" a live broadcast.

Just like how Apple's recent WWDC events are pre-edited, but still "live", I architected a pipeline that injects pre-produced VR180 content into a live HLS stream.
* **Outcome:** Delivers the excitement and urgency of a live PPV event with the production quality of post-processed video.
* **Tech:** Custom HLS manifest generation, synchronized start triggers, and a single big button to simplify UX.

### 2. Immersive Watch Party - SharePlay Architecture
Apple's `GroupSessionMessenger` is unauthenticated by default, allowing malicious clients to spoof `senderUUID` and hijack sessions.
* **Solution:** I implemented a **signed-message protocol**. Critical actions (e.g., "Start Event", "Kick User") are wrapped in a JWT and verified against a Supabase/Edge Function backend before propagation.
* **Result:** A trust-less architecture that protects paid content and prevents "griefing" in public lobbies.

### 3. Custom RealityKit Player (Forked)
Apple's native `AVPlayerViewController` does not support custom immersive environments (like side-by-side Spatial Personas) alongside 3D video.
* **Implementation:** Forked an <a href="https://github.com/mikeswanson/SpatialPlayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source RealityKit player</a> to gain low-level access to the render loop, enabling the composition of 3D video textures *behind* the translucent Spatial Persona layer.

## The Pivot to B2B: ImmersiveWatchParty SDK

Recognizing that the core value of Vantage was its networking stack, I extracted the synchronization logic into a standalone binary framework.

* **Product:** A drop-in Swift package that enables any visionOS app to add "FaceTime Watch Together" functionality.
* **Strategy:** While the B2C combat sports market matures, this SDK can be great for other businesses entering the spatial era.

## Content & Partnerships

* **Fight Night San Jose:** Scott Coker. Exclusive VR broadcast partner.
* **Dirty Boxing (DBX):** Partnered with Mike Perry and Jon Jones' league for their inaugural VR shoot in Jan 2026.
* **Up Next Fighting:** A popular up-and-coming MMA promotion in L.A.

## Data-Driven Iteration

* **Discovery:** People needed a way to find others watch with. Not many people have Vision Pros, so I built an in-app "Lobby" system that allows users to connect with other sports fans via a FaceTime call.
* **Retention:** Analysis of session data revealed that while daily active users (DAU) remain relatively low due to hardware friction, **Session Duration** for social users is extremely high (~20m+), validating the "Social VR" thesis.

## Tech Has Opened A Door For Incredible Experiences

As a combat sports fan, I've thoroughly enjoyed attending MMA events, and this project strives to give other fans the same experience. Here are some of the events I've been to:

## What's Next

* **Quest/Vision Parity:** Bridging the UX gap between the Unity-based Quest app and the SwiftUI-native visionOS app.
* **Live HLS Scaling:** Stress-testing the "Simulive" experience.
